# goreact-boilerplate

This is a boilerplate template for a fullstack application that uses a Golang backend and a React frontend.

The main goal is to provide a minimal setup to get a fullstack application working with Go and React. The application can be built using the `make` command. That will build the frontend and bundle it with the backend generating a single binary file that can be run in any environment as a standalone application.
